<p class="center"> Hi! My name is Chase Santana and I am a senior enrolled in TCMG476 at Texas A&M University.<br>
The following wall of text is a short scene written by my beautiful fiancée. Enjoy!<br><br>
	Stacy shrunk back to the wall in fear. Her eyes were wide with terror as an obscured, dark figure swooped down from the grid ceiling and into a distant corner of the cubicle.  A gargled hiss was accompanied by a swell of dense fog as it echoed throughout the desolate office. 
"I eat broccoli," Stacy confessed quietly to Marco. They huddled beneath the cramped space of a cluttered, bow front desk.  The desk belonged to their former colleague, Allen, who now remained deceased on the tacky break-room floor. Marco often pondered if a cleaning crew ever actually visited the department. The floors were consistently sticky, and through his concealed thoughts he realized that there was often a distinct and offensive odor.   
	Stacy wriggled out from under the desk. She could no longer bear the reek of her own armpits in such a confined space. She felt apologetic toward Marco. It was undoubted that he was aware of her stress sweat. If only she had used her Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant and Deodorant, she would not have been so concerned about her stench, or even have risked venturing out of the safety confines of their pocket-sized, desk cavern. 
Particles of broccoli sprayed from the far niche of the cubicle. Marco peered from under the desk and feasted his eyes upon a dark figure as it emerged in a shroud of broccoli florets. 
Marco frantically whispered, "Broccoli hears crunch munch!"
Stacy’s arms outstretched to the cubicle partition behind her. Overcome with intense horror, she traced the woven texture with the tips of her gaunt fingers. They were like skeletal hooks, desperate for a manicure, and they penetrated the surface of the partition in a razor-sharp panic. 
“No!" Stacy shrieked as the dark figure approached and absorbed her in a cyclone encompassed by broccoli florets.
