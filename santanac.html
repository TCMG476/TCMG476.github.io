<p class="center"> Hi! My name is Chase Santana and I am a senior enrolled in TCMG476 at Texas A&M University.<br>
The following wall of text is a short scene written by my beautiful fiancée. Enjoy!<br><br>
		Stacy shrunk back to the wall in fear. Her eyes were wide with terror <br>
	as an obscured, dark figure swooped down from the grid ceiling and into <br>
	a distant corner of the cubicle. A gargled hiss was accompanied by a swell <br>
	of dense fog as it echoed throughout the desolate office. <br><br>
	
		"I eat broccoli," Stacy confessed quietly to Marco. They huddled <br>
	beneath the cramped space of a cluttered, bow front desk.  The desk <br>
	belonged to their former colleague, Allen, who now remained deceased <br>
	on the tacky break-room floor. Marco often pondered if a cleaning crew <br>
	ever actually visited the department. The floors were consistently sticky, <br>
	and through his concealed thoughts he realized that there was often a distinctive <br>
	and offensive odor.   <br><br>
		
		Stacy wriggled out from under the desk. She could no longer bear the reek of <br>
	her own armpits in such a confined space. She felt apologetic toward Marco. <br>
	It was	undoubted that he was aware of her stress sweat. If only she had used her <br>
	Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant and Deodorant, she would not have been so <br>
	concerned about her stench, or even have risked venturing out of the safety confines <br>
	of their pocket-sized, desk cavern. <br><br>
	
		Particles of broccoli sprayed from the far niche of the cubicle. Marco peered from <br>
	under the desk and feasted his eyes upon a dark figure as it emerged in a shroud of <br>
	broccoli florets. <br><br>
	
		Marco frantically whispered, "Broccoli hears crunch munch!" <br><br>
	
		Stacy’s arms outstretched to the cubicle partition behind her. Overcome with intense horror, <br>
	she traced the woven texture with the tips of her gaunt fingers. They were like skeletal hooks, <br>
	desperate for a manicure, and they penetrated the surface of the partition in a razor-sharp panic. <br><br>
	
		“No!" Stacy shrieked as the dark figure approached and absorbed her in a cyclone <br>
	encompassed by broccoli florets.<br><br>
