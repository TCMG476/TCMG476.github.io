<p style="color:blue;font-size:18px;">The Objective:</p>
 <p>Knock down as many plates in the given time limit as possible.
 Times vary from 1 minute 30 seconds for Open teams to 2 minutes 30 seconds for Sportsman’s teams.
<p style="color:blue;font-size:18px;">The Equipment:</p>
 <p>Eye and ear protection is mandatory.
 One 22 rimfire pistol with unlimited magazines, two centerfire pistols of 9 MM or larger in caliber with unlimited magazines.
 The 22 rimfire targets are aperture plates meaning the team member must shoot through the 6 and 4 inch circles to knock down the plate behind. The centerfire plates are standard falling plates.
<p style="color:blue;font-size:18px;">The Procedure:</p>
 <p>All magazines may only be loaded with 6 rounds each.
 The first team member to shoot will start the clock and run from the starting table out to the shooting table, pickup and load the pistol and start knocking down plates.
 When the first shooter is finished shooting at the plates, clears and locks the slide back or opens the cylinder, he or she runs back to the start table and tags the next team member to shoot and he or she runs to their table, loads the pistol and shoots. When team member two is finished he or she makes their pistol safe and runs back to the start table to tag team member 3 at which time he or she runs to the last shooting table, loads and knocks down the last set of plates.
 All shooting must be done in the standing offhand position.
 A score of 100 points is possible if all plates are downed.</p>
